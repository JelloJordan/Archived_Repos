airship merchants, link ships and board to trade goods. Everything including money is a physical thing that your ship carries. Food too. little ai helpers unload your cargo to complete transaction.  
  
Need way to communicate with other ships. Little cb radio maybe. Ships have trucker nicknames and advertise with popup text from radio. Kiki shaped circle around text.  
  
Procedural map. Can land anywhere with anchor to ground. Can slide down anchor, winch at bottom to pull ship closer, kick ladder down super long.  
  
Extend and point blank/board for walking and docking.  
  
bad weather hurricane ocean stronger winds low visibility  
  
cannon balls bounce off of airship balloon and make noise  
  
destructible ship parts and outer hull. Magic repair system. Maybe land and cut trees into boards for repair. Coconuts for cheap cannon balls or food. Rocks for cannon balls too, each have different perks and strengths.  
  
Can hire crew members that can die  
  
patch holes with boards but use magic sap for permanent repair, takes time to fully repair


maybe no balloons, levitation engines on ship, maybe 2 that keep it running and serve as the main target for shooting and destroying  
  
Hit once go critical, if not repaired shut down completely and fall out of the sky  
  
Maybe they have hp and need more than a few shots. Can build internal wooden walls that serve as barrier for cannon balls. Can also rearrange levitation engine anywhere.
