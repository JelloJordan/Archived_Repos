# Grit

Grit is a singleplayer steampunk first person shooter in very early development.
This is just a side project at the moment so there are no guarantees of its completion.

## Development Setup

- Download the [Content](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-7vIpOlzXVTSXhcypJoBhEj64vjRoE_N?usp=share_link) folder from google drive by pressing "Download all"
- Download this repo as a zip (or clone it, but if you sync your repo often you will also need to redownload the [Content](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-7vIpOlzXVTSXhcypJoBhEj64vjRoE_N?usp=share_link) folder to stay up to date)
- Open the Content zip file and place the "Content" folder into the "Assets" folder
- Open the project with Unity 2021.3.3f1 (this will take a while at first)
- If prompted, import TMP essentials (I usually move the "Assets/TextMesh Pro" folder into the "Assets/Imports" folder)
- Open the "Main" scene under "Assets/Content/Scenes"
- Press play and enjoy!

## Screenshots
